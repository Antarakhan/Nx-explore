Affected 

How it works? 
Affected, parallel and incremental cache 

Does not matter how big the repos are. What matters is how big is the change you make 

Looks for recent changes that were made. 

Parallel flag let’s you build in a distributed fashion 

Slowest build out of all ends up being your total CI time 

Incrementality: no redo from scratch 





When developing locally, your builds are fast because your cache is stored in your machine. 



Nx is smart enough to know if it has computed before 

Initially building: nx build my-app
Second time without changing: instant 
Even if you delete the delete the dist folder 
Remember that cache is local, rm -rf node_modules/.cache then will be back to the initial run time 


What if you wanted to share the cache that you have from your machine to your coworker’s? Nx cloud 

With nx affected and Nx cloud, your builds will be a lot faster, but it’s still local 



Nx cloud 

npm install with cache from the nx account 
If someone else checks out your branch then it will be less than 20 seconds initially
